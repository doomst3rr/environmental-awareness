            Air pollution refers to the release of harmful pollutants into the air, which can have detrimental effects on human health and the environment. These pollutants can come from various sources, including industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, burning of fossil fuels, and household activities. Air pollution can take the form of gases, particulate matter, or toxic chemicals, and it can have both short-term and long-term impacts on human health, such as respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, and even premature death .

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly seven million deaths occur each year due to indoor and outdoor air pollution. It is a global issue, with 99% of the world's population breathing air that exceeds the WHO's guideline limits for pollutants. Low- and middle-income countries are particularly affected .

Air pollution can also have adverse effects on the climate and ecosystems. Many of the drivers of air pollution, such as the combustion of fossil fuels, are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. Therefore, reducing air pollution can have both health and environmental benefits, as it can lower the burden of disease and contribute to climate change mitigation .

To assess and communicate the level of air pollution, an Air Quality Index (AQI) is used. The AQI provides a measure of the air quality and the associated health concerns. It ranges from 0 to 500, with higher values indicating greater levels of air pollution and a higher health risk .

The Clean Air Act in the United States authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate and control the emissions of harmful air pollutants. The EPA sets National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six common air pollutants, including carbon monoxide, lead, ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide .

It is important to address air pollution through various measures, including the use of cleaner energy sources, improved industrial practices, stricter emission standards for vehicles, and promoting sustainable transportation and urban planning. By taking action to reduce air pollution, we can protect human health, mitigate climate change, and preserve the environment for future generations.
