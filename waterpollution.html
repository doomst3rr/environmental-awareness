            Water pollution refers to the contamination of water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, oceans, and groundwater, by harmful substances or pollutants. These pollutants can come from various sources, including industrial activities, agricultural practices, sewage discharges, and urban runoff. When contaminants mix with water bodies, they can negatively impact the water's quality and usability, leading to environmental and health problems.

            There are two main categories of water pollution based on the source of contamination:
            
            Point source pollution: This type of pollution occurs when contaminants originate from a single identifiable source, such as a factory, wastewater treatment plant, or oil spill. Point source pollution can have far-reaching effects, impacting miles of waterways and oceans.
            
            Nonpoint source pollution: Nonpoint source pollution refers to pollution that comes from diffuse sources, making it challenging to trace back to a specific origin. Examples of nonpoint source pollution include agricultural runoff, urban stormwater runoff, and seepage from septic systems. This type of pollution is widespread and can affect large areas of water bodies.
            
            Water pollution can have severe consequences for both ecosystems and human health. It can lead to the degradation of aquatic habitats, harm aquatic plants and animals, and disrupt the balance of ecosystems. Additionally, polluted water can pose risks to human health when used for drinking, cooking, or recreational activities. Contaminants in water can cause waterborne diseases, gastrointestinal issues, skin problems, and other health complications.
            
            Addressing water pollution requires a combination of preventive measures, regulations, and sustainable practices. Efforts to reduce water pollution include implementing stricter regulations on industrial and agricultural activities, improving wastewater treatment processes, promoting responsible use of fertilizers and pesticides, and implementing effective stormwater management strategies.
            
            By taking action to prevent and reduce water pollution, we can protect water resources, preserve ecosystems, and safeguard human health.
